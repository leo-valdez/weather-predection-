# weather-prediction-
While learning about data collection and its analysis, I was given this assignment of creating a weather dataset consisting of 10 conuntries for predecting the future value.
While doing this assignment I performed and learned about the following :
1. Data Scraping and its collection : After looking up at various websites, found some websites with reliable data for past 1-2 months. Coded up a scraper and then collected raw data.
2. Data Cleaning : Not each and every detail available on the raw dataset was required, removed the unrequired or non valued coloums/ rows and processed a clean dataset.
3. Data Preprocessing : Since multiple countries where required and that led to categorical dataset, normallised it and preprocessed the dataset.
                        After this the datset was ready to be used.
4. Data Analysis and visualization :  After data preprocessing was done analyzed the data and understood more about the weather in previous days(months) and made a visualization for the same.

Future Work : 

Making a proper model and predecting the future weather.
